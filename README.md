# Still Listen
A silence-first communication protocol for AI and connected systems.
Still Listen introduces a simple rule:
> Do not respond unless explicitly addressed.
The protocol reduces cognitive overload for humans and unnecessary
communication between machines.
This repository contains the conceptual definition and public disclosure
of the Still Listen protocol.
